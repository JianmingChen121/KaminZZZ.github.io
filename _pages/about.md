<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
I received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, USA in 2014. Before that, I got the B.E. degree in automation from the University of Science and Technology Beijing, China in 2008, and M.E. degree from Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, USA in 2011. I am currently a Professor at the College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.

Currently, I am mainly engaged in research on industrial intelligence, optimization methods, as well as deep learning. I have published several articles as first author in leading journals and international conferences in the field of artificial intelligence, including IEEE TEVC, IEEE TCYB, IEEE SMC, IEEE TNNLS, and I served as a reviewer for several internationally renowned journals in the field of artificial intelligence and was awarded the best reviewer in IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics 2017. I hosted two National Natural Science Foundation of China and one State Key Laboratory Open Fund; and participated in two national major R&D projects as the main participant. Before joining Sichuan University, I worked in Energy New Technologies International, Houston, USA, on the research and development of intelligent control systems, while led and completed the application of robust high-dimensional multi-objective optimization techniques based on intelligent optimization algorithms in intelligent control systems.
