This is He Zhenan's personal homepage. Please also refer to my [homepage@UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/ze-jiang). 

## !TODO: A short introduction
I received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, USA in 2014. Before that, I got the B.E. degree in automation from the University of Science and Technology Beijing, China in 2008, and M.E. degree from Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, USA in 2011. I am currently an Associate Professor at the College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. His research focuses on intelligent optimization and learning using evolutionary computation approaches.
